# Arabic-Named-Entity-Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) is considered as one of the important tasks of natural languages processing (NLP). This repository presents two approaches (machine and deep learning models )that were developed for Arabic named entity recognition (ANER).

This work for the paper referenced below [1].


The first approach is based on a traditional machine learning method of using the conditional random fields (CRF) trained with predefined set of syntactic and morphological features. 

Whereas, the second approach is based on the bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random fields layer (Bi-LSTM-CRF).
